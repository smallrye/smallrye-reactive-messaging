= Apache Kafka

The Kafka connector adds support for Kafka to Reactive Messaging.
With it you can receive Kafka Records as well as write `message` into Kafka.

The Kafka Connector is based on the https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-kafka-client/java/[Vert.x Kafka Client].

== Introduction

https://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka] is a popular distributed streaming platform.
It lets you:

* Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
* Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.
* Process streams of records as they occur.

The Kafka cluster stores streams of _records_ in categories called _topics_.
Each record consists of a _key_, a _value_, and a _timestamp_.

For more details about Kafka, check the https://kafka.apache.org/intro[documentation].
