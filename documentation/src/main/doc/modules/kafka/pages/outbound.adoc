== Writing Kafka Records

The Kafka Connector can write Reactive Messaging `Messages` as Kafka Records.

=== Example

Let's imagine you have a Kafka broker running, and accessible using the `kafka:9092` address (by default it would use `localhost:9092`).
Configure your application to write the messages from the `prices` channel into a Kafka _topic_ as follows:

[source]
----
kafka.bootstrap.servers=kafka:9092      # <1>

mp.messaging.outgoing.prices-out.connector=smallrye-kafka   # <2>
mp.messaging.outgoing.prices-out.value.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.DoubleSerializer  # <3>
mp.messaging.outgoing.prices-out.topic=prices   # <4>
----
1. Configure the broker location. You can configure it globally or per channel
2. Configure the connector to manage the `prices` channel
3. Sets the (Kafka) serializer to encode the message payload into the record's value
4. Make sure the topic name is `prices` (and not the default `prices-out`)

Then, your application must send `Message<Double>` to the `prices` channel.
It can use `double` payloads as in the following snippet:

[source, java]
----
include::example$outbound/KafkaPriceProducer.java[]
----

Or, you can send `Message<Double>`:

[source, java]
----
include::example$outbound/KafkaPriceMessageProducer.java[]
----

=== Serialization

The serialization is handled by the underlying Kafka Client.
You need to configure the:

* `mp.messaging.outgoing.[channel-name].value.serializer` to configure the value serializer (mandatory)
* `mp.messaging.outgoing.[channel-name].key.serializer` to configure the key serializer (optional, default to `String`)

If you want to use a custom serializer, add it to your `CLASSPATH` and configure the associate attribute.

By default, the written record contains:

* the `Message` payload as _value_
* no key, or the key configured using the `key` attribute or the key passed in the metadata attached to the `Message`
* the timestamp computed for the system clock (`now`) or the timestamp passed in the metadata attached to the `Message`

=== Sending key/value pairs

In the Kafka world, it's often necessary to send _records_, i.e. a key/value pair.
The connector provides the {javadoc-base}/apidocs/io/smallrye/reactive/messaging/kafka/Record.html[`io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.kafka.Record`] class that you can use to send a pair:

[source, java]
----
include::example$outbound/KafkaRecordExample.java[tag=code]
----

When the connector receives a message with a `Record` payload, it extracts the key and value from it.
The configured serializers for the key and the value must be compatible with the record's key and value.
Note that the `key` and the `value` can be `null`.
It is also possible to create a record with a `null` key AND a `null` value.

If you need more control on the written records, use `OutgoingKafkaRecordMetadata`.

=== Outbound Metadata

When sending `Messages`, you can add an instance of {javadoc-base}/apidocs/io/smallrye/reactive/messaging/kafka/api/OutgoingKafkaRecordMetadata.html[`OutgoingKafkaRecordMetadata`] to influence how the message is going to written to Kafka.
For example, you can add Kafka headers, configure the record key...

[source, java]
----
include::example$outbound/KafkaOutboundMetadataExample.java[tag=code]
----

=== Propagating Record Key

When processing messages, you can propagate incoming record key to the outgoing record.

Consider the following example method, which consumes messages from the channel `in`,
transforms the payload, and writes the result to the channel `out`.

[source, java]
----
include::example$outbound/KafkaPriceProcessor.java[tag=code]
----

Enabled with `mp.messaging.outgoing.[channel-name].propagate-record-key=true` configuration,
record key propagation produces the outgoing record with the same _key_ as the incoming record.

If the outgoing record already contains a _key_, it *won't be overridden* by the incoming record key.
If the incoming record does have a _null_ key, the `mp.messaging.outgoing.[channel-name].key` property is used.

=== Dynamic topic names

Sometimes it is desirable to select the destination of a message dynamically.
In this case, you should not configure the topic inside your application configuration file, but instead, use the outbound metadata to set the name of the topic.

For example, you can route to a dynamic topic based on the incoming message:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$outbound/KafkaOutboundDynamicTopicExample.java[tag=code]
----

=== Acknowledgement

Kafka acknowledgement can take times depending on the configuration.
Also, it stores in-memory the records that cannot be written.

By default, the connector does wait for Kafka to acknowledge the record to continue the processing (acknowledging the received `Message`).
You can disable this by setting the `waitForWriteCompletion` attribute to `false`.

Note that the `acks` attribute has a huge impact on the record acknowledgement.

If a record cannot be written, the message is `nacked`.

=== Back-pressure and inflight records

The Kafka outbound connector handles back-pressure monitoring the number of in-flight messages waiting to be written to the Kafka broker.
The number of in-flight messages is configured using the `max-inflight-messages` attribute and defaults to 1024.

The connector only sends that amount of messages concurrently.
No other messages will be sent until at least one in-flight message gets acknowledged by the broker.
Then, the connector writes a new message to Kafka when one of the broker's in-flight messages get acknowledged.
Be sure to configure Kafka's `batch.size` and `linger.ms` accordingly.

You can also remove the limit of inflight messages by setting `max-inflight-messages` to `0`.
However, note that the Kafka Producer may block if the number of requests reaches `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection`.

=== Sending Cloud Events

The Kafka connector supports https://cloudevents.io/[Cloud Events].
The connector sends the outbound record as Cloud Events if:

* the message metadata contains an `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.ce.OutgoingCloudEventMetadata` instance,
* the channel configuration defines the `cloud-events-type` and `cloud-events-source` attributes.

You can create `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.ce.OutgoingCloudEventMetadata` instances using:

[source, java]
----
include::example$outbound/KafkaCloudEventProcessor.java[]
----

If the metadata does not contain an id, the connector generates one (random UUID).
The `type` and `source` can be configured per message or at the channel level using the `cloud-events-type` and `cloud-events-source` attributes.
Other attributes are also configurable.

The metadata can be contributed by multiple methods, however, you must always retrieve the already existing metadata to avoid overriding the values:

[source, java]
----
include::example$outbound/KafkaCloudEventMultipleProcessors.java[]
----

By default, the connector sends the Cloud Events using the _binary_ format.
You can write _structured_ Cloud Events by setting the `cloud-events-mode` to `structured`.
Only JSON is supported, so the created records had its `content-type` header set to `application/cloudevents+json; charset=UTF-8`
When using the _structured_ mode, the value serializer must be set to `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer`, otherwise the connector reports the error.
In addition, in _structured_, the connector maps the message's payload to JSON, except for `String` passed directly.

The record's key can be set in the channel configuration (`key` attribute), in the `OutgoingKafkaRecordMetadata` or using the `partitionkey` Cloud Event attribute.

NOTE: you can disable the Cloud Event support by setting the `cloud-events` attribute to `false`

=== Using `ProducerRecord`

Kafka built-in type https://kafka.apache.org/26/javadoc/index.html?org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/ProducerRecord.html[ProducerRecord<K,V>] can also be used for producing messages:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$outbound/KafkaProducerRecordExample.java[tag=code]
----

WARNING: This is an advanced feature.
The `ProducerRecord` is sent to Kafka as is.
Any possible metadata attached through `Message<ProducerRecord<K, V>>` are ignored and lost.

=== Configuration Reference

include::connectors:partial$META-INF/connector/smallrye-kafka-outgoing.adoc[]

You can also pass any property supported by the underlying https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#producerconfigs[Kafka producer].

For example, to configure the `batch.size` property, use:

[source,properties]
----
mp.messaging.outgoing.[channel].batch.size=32768
----

Some producer client properties are configured to sensible default values:

If not set, `reconnect.backoff.max.ms` is set to `10000` to avoid high load on disconnection.

If not set, `key.serializer` is set to `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer`.

If not set, producer `client.id` is generated as `kafka-producer-[channel]`.
