= Consuming data

To consume data (act as a data sink), you just need a method only annotated with `@Incoming`.

== Supported Signatures

* `@Incoming Subscriber<Message<I>> method()`
* `@Incoming Subscriber<I> method()`
* `@Incoming void method(I msg)`
* `@Incoming CompletionStage<?> method(Message<I> msg)`
* `@Incoming CompletionStage<?> method(I msg)`

The two first methods return a Reactive Streams `Subscriber`. The other methods consume the incoming items one by one.
Notice that, when returning a `CompletionStage`, the method won't be called until the previously returned
`CompletionStage` is completed.

== Examples

The following code snippet provides example of the different variants of signature.
