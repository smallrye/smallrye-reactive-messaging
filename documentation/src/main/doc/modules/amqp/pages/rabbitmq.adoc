== Using RabbitMQ

This connector is for AMQP 1.0.
RabbitMQ implements AMQP 0.9.1.
RabbitMQ does not provide AMQP 1.0 by default, but there is a plugin for it.
To use RabbitMQ with this connector, enable and configure the https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-amqp1.0/blob/v3.8.x/README.md[AMQP 1.0 plugin].

Despite the plugin, a few features won't work with RabbitMQ.
Thus, we recommend the following configurations.

To receive messages from RabbitMQ:

* Set `durable` to `false`

[source, properties]
----
mp.messaging.incoming.prices.connector=smallrye-amqp
mp.messaging.incoming.prices.durable=false
----

To send messages to RabbitMQ:

* set the destination `address` (anonymous sender are not supported)
* set `use-anonymous-sender` to `false`

[source, properties]
----
mp.messaging.outgoing.generated-price.connector=smallrye-amqp
mp.messaging.outgoing.generated-price.address=prices
mp.messaging.outgoing.generated-price.use-anonymous-sender=false
----

As a consequence, it's not possible to change the destination dynamically (using message metadata) when using RabbitMQ.

Alternatively, you can use the xref:rabbitmq:rabbitmq.adoc[RabbitMQ connector].
