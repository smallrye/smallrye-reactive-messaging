= Concepts

When dealing with event-driven or data streaming applications, there are a few concepts and vocabulary to introduce.

[#messages]
== Messages, Payload, Metadata

A `Message` is an _envelope_ around a `payload`.
Your application is going to receive, process, and send `Messages`.

Your application's logic can generate these `Messages` or receive them from a message broker.
They can also be consumed by your application or sent to a message broker.

In Reactive Messaging, `Message` are represented by the {javadoc-base}/org/eclipse/microprofile/reactive/messaging/Message.html[`Message`] class.
Each `Message<T>` contains a _payload_ of type `<T>`. This payload can be retrieved using `message.getPayload()`:

As you can see in the previous snippet, `Messages` can also have _metadata_.
_Metadata_ is a way to extend messages with additional data.
It can be metadata related to the message broker ({javadoc-base}/apidocs/io/smallrye/reactive/messaging/kafka/api/KafkaMessageMetadata.html[`KafkaMessageMetadata`] for instance), or contain operational data (such as tracing metadata), or business-related data.

NOTE: When retrieving metadata, you get an `Optional` as it may not be present.

TIP: Metadata is also used to influence the outbound dispatching (how the message will be sent to the broker).

[#channels]
== Channels and Streams


Inside your application, `Messages` transit on _channel_.
A _channel_ is a virtual destination identified by a name.

SmallRye Reactive Messaging connects the component to the channel they read and to the channel they populate.
The resulting structure is a stream: Messages flow between components through channels.

[NOTE]
.What about Reactive Streams?
====
You may wonder why _Reactive Messaging_ has _Reactive_ in the name.
The Messaging part is kind of obvious.
The Reactive part comes from the streams that are created by binding components.
These streams are https://www.reactive-streams.org/[Reactive Streams].
They follow the subscription and request protocol and implement back-pressure.
It also means that <<Connectors>> are intended to use non-blocking IO to interact with the various message brokers.

[#connectors]
== Connectors

Your application is interacting with messaging brokers or event backbone using _connectors_.
A _connector_ is a piece of code that connects to a broker and:

1. subscribe/poll/receive messages from the broker and propagate them to the application
2. send/write/dispatch messages provided by the application to the broker

Connectors are configured to map incoming messages to a specific _channel_ (consumed by the application) and collect outgoing messages sent to a specific channel.
These collected messages are sent to the external broker.

Each connector is dedicated to a specific technology.
For example, a Kafka Connector only deals with Kafka.

You don't necessarily need a connector.
When your application does not use connectors, everything happens _in-memory_, and the streams are created by chaining methods altogether.
Each chain is still a reactive stream and enforces the back-pressure protocol.
When you don't use connectors, you need to make sure the chain is complete, meaning it starts with a message source, and it ends with a sink.
In other words, you need to generate messages from within the application (using a method with only `@Outgoing`, or an `Emitter`) and consume the messages from within the application (using a method with only `@Incoming` or using an unmanaged stream).
