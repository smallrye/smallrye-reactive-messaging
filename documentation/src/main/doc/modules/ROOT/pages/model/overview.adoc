== A brief overview of the annotations

Reactive Messaging provides two main annotations:

* `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming` - indicates the consumed channel
* `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Outgoing` - indicates the populated channel

These annotations are used on #methods#:

[source,java]
----
include::example$beans/MessageProcessingBean.java[]
----

NOTE: Reactive Messaging beans can either be in the _application_ scope (`@ApplicationScoped`) or dependent scope (`@Dependent`).

Manipulating messages can be cumbersome.
When you are only interested by the payload, you can use the following syntax:
The following code is equivalent to the snippet from above:

[source,java]
----
include::example$beans/PayloadProcessingBean.java[]
----

IMPORTANT: You should not call methods annotated with `@Incoming` and/or `@Outgoing` directly from your code.
They are invoked by the framework.
Having user code invoking them would not have the expected outcome.

SmallRye Reactive Messaging automatically binds matching `@Outgoing` to `@Incoming` to form a chain:

If we consider the following code:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$beans/Chain.java[tag=chain]
----

It would generate the following chain:

[source, text]
----
generate --> [ source ] --> process --> [ sink ] --> consume
----

Methods annotated with `@Incoming` or `@Outgoing` don't have to be in the same _bean_ (_class_). You can distribute them
among a set of beans. Remote interactions are also possible when using connectors.

Methods annotated with:

* only `@Outgoing` are used to generate messages or payloads
* only `@Incoming` are used to consume messages or payloads
* both `@Incoming` and `@Outgoing` are used to process messages or payloads; or transform the stream
