== Message Converters

SmallRye Reactive Messaging supports _message converters_, allowing to transform an incoming message into a version accepted by the method.
If the incoming messages or payload does not match the invoked method's expectation, SmallRye Reactive Messaging looks for a suitable converter.
If found, it converts the incoming message with this converter.

Converters can have multiple purposes, but the main use case is about transforming the message's payload:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$converters/MyConverter.java[tag=code]
----

To provide a converter, implement a bean exposing the `MessageConverter` interface.
The `canConvert` method is called during the lookup and verifies if it can handle the conversion.
The `target` type is the expected payload type.
If the converter returns `true` to `canConvert`, SmallRye Reactive Messaging calls the `convert` method to proceed to the conversion.

The previous converter can be used in application like the following, to convert `Message<String>` to `Message<Person>`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$converters/ConverterExample.java[tag=code]
----

Converters work for all supported method signatures.
However, the signature must be well-formed to allow the extraction of the expected payload type.
Wildcards and raw types do not support conversion.
If the expected payload type cannot be extracted, or no converter fits, the message is passed as received.

If multiple suitable converters are present, implementations should override the `getPriority` method returning the priority.
The default priority is `100`.
The converter lookup invokes converters with higher priority first.
