== Processing streams

The previous processing method were taking single `Message` or payload.
Sometimes you need more advanced manipulation.
For this, SmallRye Reactive Messaging lets you process the stream of `Message` or the stream of payloads directly:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$processing/StreamExamples.java[tag=processing-stream-message]
----

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$processing/StreamExamples.java[tag=processing-stream-payload]
----

You can receive either a (Reactive Streams) `Publisher`, a `PublisherBuilder` or (Mutiny) `Multi`.
You can return any sub-class of `Publisher` or a `Publisher` directly.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These signatures do not support metadata propagation.
In the case of a stream of `Message`, you need to propagate the metadata manually.
In the case of a stream of payload, propagation is not supported, and incoming metadata are lost.
