== Using the JMS connector

To you the JMS Connector, add the following dependency to your project:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.smallrye.reactive</groupId>
  <artifactId>smallrye-reactive-messaging-jms</artifactId>
  <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

The connector name is: `smallrye-jms`.

So, to indicate that a channel is managed by this connector you need:

[source]
----
# Inbound
mp.messaging.incoming.[channel-name].connector=smallrye-jms

# Outbound
mp.messaging.outgoing.[channel-name].connector=smallrye-jms
----

The JMS Connector requires a `javax.jms.ConnectionFactory` to be exposed (as CDI bean).
The connector looks for a `javax.jms.ConnectionFactory` and delegate the interaction with the JMS server to this factory.
In other words, it creates the JMS connection and context using this factory.

So, in order to use this connector you would need to expose a `javax.jms.ConnectionFactory`:

[source, java]
----
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;
import javax.jms.ConnectionFactory;

import org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.client.ActiveMQJMSConnectionFactory;

@ApplicationScoped
public class ConnectionFactoryBean {

    @Produces
    ConnectionFactory factory() {
        return new ActiveMQJMSConnectionFactory(
                "tcp://localhost:61616",
                null, null);
    }

}
----

The factory class may depends on your JMS connector/server.
